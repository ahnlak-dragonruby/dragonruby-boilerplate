# metadata

This folder contains metadata used to build your project for release. `game_metadata.txt` must be
filled in with appropriate information.

Note that the entries in the example `game_metadata.txt` file are all commented out (the '#' at
the beginning of each line), so be sure to remove that '#' when you put in your own details.
